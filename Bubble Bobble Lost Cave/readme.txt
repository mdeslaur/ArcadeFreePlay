These patches add freeplay to the Bubble Bobble Lost Cave v1.2 roms.

They were ported from patches that appeared for the original Bubble Bobble
roms and were available in this forum thread:

http://www.jammaplus.co.uk/forum/forum_posts.asp?TID=70581

Unfortunately, jammaplus.co.uk went away, so I don't know who the author of
the original patches is. If you know who it is, please let me know.

There are two different versions of the Lost Cave roms: the roms for
original boards which come in the bublcave.zip file, and the roms for the
bootleg boards which come in either bootlegLostCave.zip or boblbobl.zip.

This freeplay patch is only for the bootleg roms, and only work for v1.2 of
Lost Cave.

You can apply the patches like so:

xdelta3.exe -d -s old\bb3 bb3.patch new\bb3
xdelta3.exe -d -s old\bb4 bb4.patch new\bb4
